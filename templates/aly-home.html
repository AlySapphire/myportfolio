            <p>
                I'm an aspiring game developer from NSW. I'm currently Technical Producer and Lead Programmer at Insert Dragon Here where
                I manage our technical collaboration systems, develop gameplay mechanics and develop modular tools for use
                in game systems. Video Games have been part of my life ever since I was a kid, bringing me a lot of joy and
                entertainment. I hope to pass on that joy by making unique experiences for people to enjoy.
                <br />
                <br /> I specialise in Visual C++ development and have experience in low-level API's such as OpenGL, FMOD
                and SDL2. I have in depth experience with Git on the command line and through Sourcetree. I'm a highly experienced
                UE4 developer having a high level of knowledge both C++ and Blueprints. I'm a highly-skilled Unity3D developer
                having made several projects with the engine. I'm a confident C# developer having experience with the .NET
                framework.
                <br />
                <br /> My main programming interests include gameplay mechanics programming, algorithm design, AI programming
                and engine and framework development. I also enjoy UI interactivity and anything programming related really.
                Outside of Programming I love watching cartoons and cooking pizza's and pastries.
